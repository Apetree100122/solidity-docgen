# `solidity-docgen`

*solidity-docgen is a program that extracts documentation for a Solidity project.*

The output is fully configurable through Handlebars templates, but the default templates should do a good job of displaying all of the information in the source code in Markdown format. The generated Markdown files can be used with a static site generator such as Vuepress, MkDocs, Jekyll (GitHub Pages), etc., in order to publish a documentation website.
